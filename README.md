# Adaptive-Morphology-Filter
The code is for the paper Adaptive Morphology Filter for Deep Hyperspectral Image Classification.
Deep neural network models significantly outperform classical algorithms in the Hyperspectral Images (HSI) classification task. These deep models improve generalization, but incur significant computation demands. This paper endeavors to alleviate the computational distress in a depthwise manner through the use of morphological operations. We propose the Adaptive Morphology Filter (AMF) to extract spatial features like the conventional depthwise convolution layer effectively. Furthermore, we re-parameterize AMF into its equivalent form, i.e., a traditional binary morphology filter, which drastically reduces the number of parameters in the inference phase. Finally, we stack multiple AMFs to achieve a large receptive field and construct a lightweight AMNet for classifying hyperspectral images. It is noteworthy that we prove the deep stack of depthwise AMFs to be equivalent to structural element decomposition. We test our model on three benchmark datasets. Experiments show that our approach outperforms SOTAs with fewer parameters ($\approx 32 k$).
I will write in more detail later.
